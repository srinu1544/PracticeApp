/* Geocoding is the process of converting an address into geographic coordinates.
These coordinates can be used to place markers on a map or position the map.

The Android API has a Geocoder class that can perform both forward and reverse geocoding.
Forward geocoding uses a location name or latitude and longitude values to get more details
about an address. Reverse geocoding converts geographic coordinates into an address.

Geocoding is different from geolocation. Geolocation is the process of determining the
location of a device using its geographical coordinates.*/
