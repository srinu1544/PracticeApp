Geofencing is a location-based service that can be used on Android devices.
It allows devices to monitor a circular area and send a notification when it
enters or exits that area. This can be useful for apps that want to use location as a trigger

For example, a company could send promotions to customers' smartphones when they enter a store,
mall, or neighborhood.
To enable geofencing on Android devices, you can do the following:
Go to Device Management on the MDM server
Enter the place's longitude and latitude
Choose the preferred radius of your new Geofence
Choose the name for it
For best results, the minimum radius of the geofence should be set between 100 - 150 meters.
When Wi-Fi is available location accuracy is usually between 20 - 50 meters.
