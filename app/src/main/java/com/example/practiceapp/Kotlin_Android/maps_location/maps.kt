The Google Maps app for Android can help you find directions,
navigate, and save locations. It uses real-time traffic information
to find the best route to your destination. You can also get voice navigation,
which can tell you when to turn, what lane to use, and if there's a better route.

Here are some things you can do with Google Maps on Android:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Find directions
Customize your route
Get voice navigation
Save locations

To get directions, you can:
---------------------------
Open the Google Maps app
Search for your destination
Tap Directions in the bottom left
Tap Driving at the top
Tap More in the top right
Turn on Avoid tolls or Avoid highways

If Google Maps isn't working, you can try these steps:
------------------------------------------------------
Update the app
Connect to a stronger Wi-Fi signal
Recalibrate the app
Check your location services
Reinstall the app
Restart your phone */
