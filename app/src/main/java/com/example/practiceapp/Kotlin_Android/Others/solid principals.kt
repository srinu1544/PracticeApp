/*SOLID is an acronym for five principles of object-oriented programming (OOP):

Single responsibility principle (SRP):
Open-closed principle (OCP):
Liskov substitution principle (LSP):
Interface segregation principle (ISP):
Dependency inversion principle (DIP):

SOLID principles help software developers create object-oriented software systems that are:
Robust, Testable, Extensible, Maintainable.

In Android, SOLID principles are applied using Android Architecture Components like the
Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM). MVVM separates the application's logic from its UI,
making it easier to maintain and extend */
