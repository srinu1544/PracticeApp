/*Intent Service (Deprecated in Android 10+):
-------------------------------------------
IntentService is a subclass of Service that handles asynchronous requests (Intents) one at a time
in a worker thread. It's often used for performing background tasks in response to Intents, and
it automatically stops itself when it has no more work to do.*/
