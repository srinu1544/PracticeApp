Kotlin, like many programming languages, has a variety of data types that allow you to work with different kinds of data. Here are some of the common data types in Kotlin:

1. **Numbers**:
- `Byte`: 8-bit signed integer.
- `Short`: 16-bit signed integer.
- `Int`: 32-bit signed integer.
- `Long`: 64-bit signed integer.
- `Float`: 32-bit floating-point number.
- `Double`: 64-bit double-precision floating-point number.

2. **Characters**:
- `Char`: Represents a single 16-bit Unicode character.

3. **Booleans**:
- `Boolean`: Represents a true or false value.



non- primitive data types :
---------------------------

4. **Text**:
- `String`: Represents a sequence of characters.

5. **Arrays**:
- `Array`: Represents a generic array with a specified type.

6. **Collections**:
- `List`: Represents an ordered collection of elements.
- `Set`: Represents an unordered collection of unique elements.
- `Map`: Represents a collection of key-value pairs.

7. **Ranges**:
- `ClosedRange`: Represents a closed range of values, typically used with range expressions like `1..10`.

8. **Nullability**:
- Kotlin has a type modifier called `?` which can be added to any type to indicate that it can hold a null value. For example, `String?` means a nullable string.

9. **User-Defined Types**:
- You can define your own data types using classes and data classes in Kotlin.

10. **Enums**:
- `enum class`: Represents a finite set of values, often used for defining constants and symbolic values.

11. **Function Types**:
- Kotlin treats functions as first-class citizens, and you can define function types like `(Int, Int) -> Int`, which represents a function that takes two integers and returns an integer.


12. **Any and Nothing**:
- `Any`: The supertype of all non-nullable types.
- `Nothing`: A type with no values. It's often used to indicate that a function never returns normally.

13. **Type Aliases**:
- You can create custom type aliases using the `typealias` keyword to make your code more readable and maintainable.

These are some of the core data types in Kotlin. Kotlin's type system is designed to be concise, expressive, and safe, allowing you to work with a wide range of data in a clear and efficient manner.
