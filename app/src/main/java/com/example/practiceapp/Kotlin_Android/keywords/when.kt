/*The when expression in Kotlin is a powerful construct that can be used to replace the switch
statement in Java. It is a versatile expression that can be used in a variety of ways,
and it is often considered to be more readable and maintainable than the switch statement.

The when expression takes a value as input and checks the value against the condition provided.
 If there is a match present for the value passed to the when expression, then the matched
 condition block will be executed. If there is no match, then the default block will be executed.

The when expression can be used with or without arguments. When used without arguments,
the when expression will evaluate to the first condition that matches the value. When used
with arguments, the when expression will evaluate to the first condition that matches the
value and returns the result of the expression.

The when expression can also be used to check for multiple conditions. For example, the
following when expression will check if the value is equal to 1, 2, or 3:


when (value) {
    1 -> println("The value is 1")
    2 -> println("The value is 2")
    3 -> println("The value is 3")
    else -> println("The value is not 1, 2, or 3")
}*/
