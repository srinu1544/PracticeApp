/*In Kotlin, the Unit type is a special type that represents the absence of a value.
It is similar to the void type in Java, but it is a real class with a single instance.
The Unit type is used as the return type of functions that do not return any meaningful
value, such as functions that perform side effects or functions that return nothing.

Here is an example of a function that returns Unit:
fun greet() {
  println("Hello, world!")
}

This function does not return any meaningful value, so it returns Unit.
It is also a convention to omit the Unit type from the return type of a
function when the function returns Unit.

The Unit type can also be used as a value. For example, you can assign the value
 Unit to a variable or pass it as an argument to a function.

Here is an example of how to use the Unit type as a value:
val result = Unit
println(result) // prints "kotlin.Unit"


In this example, the variable result is assigned the value Unit. The println() function then
prints the value of result, which is "kotlin.Unit".

The Unit type is a useful way to represent the absence of a value in Kotlin. It is also a
convenient way to return nothing from a function or to pass nothing as an argument to a function.*/
