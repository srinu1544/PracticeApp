/*DVM stands for Dalvik Virtual Machine.
 It's a virtual machine that executes Android applications.
 DVM is optimized for memory, battery life, and performance.
 It's designed to run on low-powered devices.

DVM is a Java virtual machine. It was developed by Dan Bornstein and other Google engineers as
part of the Android mobile platform. DVM is register-based, while JVM is stack-based.

DVM compiles Java code to an intermediate format called Java bytecode. It uses its own 16-bit
 instruction set that works directly on local variables.


 The DVM works by:

Compiling Java code: The DVM compiles Java code into Java bytecode (.class file).
Converting bytecode: The DVM uses a tool called Dalvik eXchange or dx to convert Java bytecode to Dalvik bytecode.
Translating bytecode: The DVM translates the Dalvik bytecode to binary machine code.

The DVM also:
Optimizes the virtual machine for memory, battery life, and performance
Converts class files into .dex files
Converts multiple class files into dex files
The DVM converts bytecode every time a specific app is launched
