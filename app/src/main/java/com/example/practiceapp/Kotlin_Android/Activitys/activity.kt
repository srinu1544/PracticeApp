/*
In Android, an "activity" is a fundamental building block of an app's user interface and represents a single
screen with a user interface. Activities are the primary way that users interact with your app and can be
thought of as windows in a traditional desktop application. Each activity typically has its own layout,
widgets, and functionality.
