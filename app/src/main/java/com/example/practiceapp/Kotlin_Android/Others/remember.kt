In Jetpack Compose, the remember {} function serves a crucial purpose:
it helps manage state across recompositions. Recompositions are the process of rebuilding the UI
tree whenever necessary, like when data changes or a user interacts with the app. Without proper
state management, changes wouldn't persist during these rebuilds, making the UI inconsistent and unresponsive.

Here's how remember {} works:

1. Stores values across recompositions:

You place any object or variable inside the curly braces of remember {}.
The function internally stores this value in a cache associated with the current composition.
Whenever a recomposition happens, the value held by remember {} remains accessible and consistent,
regardless of how many times the surrounding composable function rebuilds.

2. Different scenarios:

Inside a composable function, calling remember {} for the same value multiple times only results in one
 copy being stored in the cache. This avoids unnecessary calculations and memory overhead.

If you pass different values inside remember {} during recompositions, a new cached entry is created for
each unique value.

3. Common use cases:

Storing user input like entered text or selected items.
Caching expensive calculations or network requests to avoid repeating them on each recomposition.
Keeping track of the current UI state like scroll position or selected tab.
4. Important note:

Remember that remember {} only holds references, not the actual values themselves. If the referenced object
changes internally, the UI won't be automatically updated unless you also trigger a recomposition of the
affected composable.

By understanding the functionalities and nuances of remember {}, you can effectively manage state and build
dynamic and responsive Jetpack Compose UIs. If you have further questions or want specific examples of its
usage, feel free to ask!*/
