/* Maven and Gradle are both build automation tools. Maven is open source and focuses on
performance and flexibility. Gradle is a build management and comprehension tool that controls
project builds, reports, and documents.


Maven :
-------
Suitable for: Small projects that don't require build process customization
Build process: Uses a fixed, linear model of phases
Language: Uses XML for project configuration
Scripts: Slightly longer than Gradle's

Gradle :
--------
Suitable for: Large-scale projects with many modules, including Android apps
Build process: Uses a graph of task dependencies
Language: Uses a domain-specific language based on Groovy
Scripts: Shorter and cleaner than Maven's

Gradle is usually preferred for build automation in languages like:
Java, Scala, Android, C/C++, Groovy
