/*Pattern #2 ðŸ‘Œ Factory :

As the name suggests, Factory takes care of all the object creational logic.
In this pattern, a factory class controls which object to instantiate. Factory
pattern comes in handy when dealing with many common objects. You can use it
where you might not want to specify a concrete class.*/
