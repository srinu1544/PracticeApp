/*
Build variants in Android are the result of Gradle using a set of rules to combine
settings, code, and resources configured in your build types and product flavors.

By default, new Android projects have two build types: debug and release. Debug is used when
you run the application from the IDE directly onto a device. Release requires you to sign
the APK.

You can find four build variants in Android Studio:
Debug,
Release,
MinifiedDebug,
NewBuildType.
You can choose any of these for your build.

Build flavors define what is built for each variant of the module.
For example,

build flavors can define:

Which resource and source code files are to be included in the build
Having a paid version of your app
Having a version for each store you upload to, such as Amazon Appstore, Google Play Store,
and Samsung Galaxy Store
You can create product flavors by defining rules in the build.gradle*/
