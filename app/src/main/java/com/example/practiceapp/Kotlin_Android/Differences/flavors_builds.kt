/*What is the difference between build type and flavor?

That means s/he is describing what actually now it is in flavor after the build.

 build :
 -------
 builds is like environments like release build , debug build testing build.

 Build Types: In Android apps, build types usually refer to the environment in which you're
 running the app. Every module has to debug and release build types by default, but you can
 define more as needed.


 flavours :
 ----------

 Product Flavors is a structure similar to Build Types that provides flexibility.
 The main difference is that it allows us to generate different versions of the
 application from a shared codebase. Android Product Flavors are used to create
 different versions of an app

 like : paid version , free version
