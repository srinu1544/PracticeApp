/*interceptors
--------------
There are multiple matches for interceptors, including a programming function and a type of
aircraft.

In programming, an interceptor is a function that is called before or after an action invocation.
Interceptors are used to perform tasks that are separate from the application's business logic,
such as logging, auditing, and profiling. Interceptors are an important part of an application,
but they don't solve business problems*/
