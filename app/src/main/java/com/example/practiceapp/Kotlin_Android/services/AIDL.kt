/*AIDL (Android Interface Definition Language):
---------------------------------------------
AIDL is used to create and communicate with services across different applications. It's
often used in situations where inter-process communication (IPC) is required.
These are some of the main types of services in Android, and each serves a specific purpose
in managing background tasks and providing functionality to Android applications. The choice
of which type of service to use depends on the requirements of your app and the nature of the
task you want to perform in the background.*/
