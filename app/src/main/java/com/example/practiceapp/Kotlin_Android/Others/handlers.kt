/*A Handler in Kotlin is a class that allows you to schedule and execute tasks on the UI thread.
It operates on a message queue, which allows you to post messages or runnable to be executed on
the UI thread.

Here is an example of how to use a Handler in Kotlin:
import android.os.Handler
import android.os.Looper

class MyHandler(looper: Looper) : Handler(looper) {

    fun handleMessage(msg: Message) {
        // Do something with the message
    }
}

// Create a Handler
val handler = MyHandler(Looper.getMainLooper())

// Post a message to the Handler
handler.post {
    // Do something
}

Handlers are a powerful tool for managing tasks in the background and updating the UI.
However, it is important to use them correctly, as they can lead to concurrency issues
if not used properly.
