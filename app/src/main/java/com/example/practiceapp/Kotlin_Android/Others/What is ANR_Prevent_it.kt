ANR stands for "Application Not Responding," and it's an error condition that can occur
in Android applications when the user interface thread (also known as the main thread)
of an app becomes unresponsive for an extended period of time. When this happens,
Android may display a dialog to the user, asking if they want to wait for the app
to respond or force close it.

ANRs can be caused by a variety of reasons, such as:

Long-running operations on the main thread:
Any operation that takes a significant amount of time to complete, such as network requests
or complex calculations, should be performed in the background to avoid blocking the main
thread.

Deadlocks:
Deadlocks occur when multiple threads are waiting for each other to release resources,
causing all of them to become unresponsive.

Infinite loops or excessive CPU usage:
Code that runs in a loop without proper exit
conditions or code that consumes excessive CPU resources can lead to ANRs.

To prevent ANRs in Android applications, you should follow these best practices:

Use Async Tasks or Background Threads: Offload long-running operations, such as network
requests or file I/O, to background threads or Async Tasks to avoid blocking the main
thread. AsyncTask has been deprecated in more recent versions of Android, so consider
using Kotlin Coroutines or Java's Executor framework for modern Android development.

Use Services for Long-running Operations: If you need to perform background operations
that should continue even if your app's UI is not visible, consider using Android Services.
Services allow you to perform tasks in the background without blocking the UI thread.

Handle UI Responsiveness:
Ensure that your app's UI remains responsive by minimizing the work done on the main thread. Avoid performing heavy calculations or network operations on the main thread.

Optimize Database Operations:
When working with databases, use appropriate techniques such as database indexing and
pagination to optimize data retrieval and storage.

Use the Android Profiler:
Use tools like Android Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks and issues in your app.
This tool can help you pinpoint areas where your app may become unresponsive.

Monitor ANR Reports:
Keep an eye on ANR reports in the Android Developer Console. These reports can provide
insights into the specific scenarios where your app is becoming unresponsive in the wild.

Implement Timeout Mechanisms:
If your app depends on external resources like network
requests, implement timeout mechanisms to handle cases where the resource is not available
or takes too long to respond.

Optimize UI Rendering:
Use efficient UI components and layouts to minimize rendering time. Consider using
RecyclerView for large lists and ConstraintLayout for complex layouts.

By following these best practices and regularly testing your app's performance,
you can reduce the likelihood of ANRs and provide a smoother user experience for
your Android app users.
