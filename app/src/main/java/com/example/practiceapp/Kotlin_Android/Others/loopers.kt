/*What is Looper?
-----------------

Looper is a class which is used to execute the Messages(Runnables) in a queue. Normal threads have
 no such queue, e.g. simple thread does not have any queue. It executes once and after method
 execution finishes, the thread will not run another Message(Runnable).

Where we can use Looper class?
-------------------------------

If someone wants to execute multiple messages(Runnables) then he should use the Looper class which
is responsible for creating a queue in the thread. For example, while writing an application that
downloads files from the internet, we can use Looper class to put files to be downloaded in the
queue.

How it works?
-------------

There is prepare() method to prepare the Looper. Then you can use loop() method to create a message
loop in the current thread and now your Looper is ready to execute the requests in the queue until
you quit the loop.

Here is the code by which you can prepare the Looper.

class LooperThread extends Thread {
      public Handler mHandler;

      @Override
      public void run() {
          Looper.prepare();

          mHandler = new Handler() {
              @Override
              public void handleMessage(Message msg) {
                  // process incoming messages here
              }
          };

          Looper.loop();
      }
  }*/
