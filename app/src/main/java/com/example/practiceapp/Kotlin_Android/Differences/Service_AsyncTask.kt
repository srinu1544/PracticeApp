/* Difference bw service and async task ?

In Android, both Services and AsyncTask are used to perform background tasks, but they serve
different purposes and have different characteristics. Here are the key differences between
Services and AsyncTask in Android:

Purpose:

Service:
A Service is an Android component that performs long-running tasks in the background, independently
of the user interface. It is typically used for tasks that need to run continuously or for an
extended period, such as playing music, handling network requests, or monitoring sensors.

AsyncTask:
AsyncTask is a class that allows you to perform short-lived background operations and update the UI
thread with the results. It is typically used for tasks that are relatively quick, such as downloading
a small file or processing data in the background before updating the UI.
Execution Context:

Service:
Services run on the main UI thread by default, so you need to handle multithreading manually if your
service performs intensive tasks to prevent blocking the UI. However, you can create a Service that
runs on a separate background thread or even a separate process to avoid UI blocking.

AsyncTask:
AsyncTask is designed for short-lived background operations and automatically runs on a separate worker
thread, making it easier to perform tasks without blocking the UI thread. AsyncTask provides convenient
methods for updating the UI thread when the background task is completed.

Lifecycle:
Service: Services have their own lifecycle, including methods like onCreate(), onStartCommand(),
and onDestroy(). They can run indefinitely or be explicitly started and stopped by the application.

AsyncTask: AsyncTask instances are short-lived and typically created and executed within an Activity
or Fragment. They do not have their own lifecycle, and once the task is completed, an AsyncTask cannot
be restarted.

Use Cases:

Service: Services are suitable for tasks that need to run continuously or periodically in the background,
such as music playback, GPS location tracking, or managing push notifications.

AsyncTask: AsyncTask is suitable for quick, short-duration background tasks, such as downloading data
from a web server, processing images, or performing calculations.

Communication:
Service: Services can communicate with other components in the app, such as Activities or Fragments,
using Intents or other mechanisms like Bound Services for more complex interactions.
AsyncTask: AsyncTask is often used for simple background tasks within the scope of an Activity or
Fragment, so communication with other components can be done directly through method calls or callbacks.

In summary, Services and AsyncTask serve different purposes in Android development. Services are better
suited for long-running background tasks, while AsyncTask is designed for shorter, non-blocking
operations that can be easily integrated with the UI thread. It's important to choose the appropriate
tool for the specific task you need to accomplish in your Android application. Additionally, consider
modern alternatives like Kotlin Coroutines or RxJava for more advanced concurrency management in
Android apps
