Foreground Service:
--------------------
A foreground service is a service that has a visible notification associated with it.
This notification informs the user that the service is running, and it's often used for
tasks that are considered important to the user, such as music playback or GPS tracking.
Foreground services have a higher priority and are less likely to be killed by the system.
