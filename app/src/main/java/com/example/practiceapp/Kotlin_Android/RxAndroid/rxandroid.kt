package com.example.practiceapp.Kotlin_Android.RxAndroid

/*

RxAndroid is an extension of RxJava for Android applications. It adds the Android-required Main Thread,
which is needed for multithreading in Android. RxAndroid also provides AndroidSchedulers.

RxAndroid contains the Android threads to be used in the Android Environment. It adds the minimum classes
to RxJava that make writing reactive components in Android applications easy.

RxJava is a JVM library for doing asynchronous and executing event-based programs by using observable
sequences. It uses different threads, such as a background thread for the network call and the main
thread for updating the UI.
RxAndroid and RxKotlin use the same rxjava types, so they can interoperate freely.
