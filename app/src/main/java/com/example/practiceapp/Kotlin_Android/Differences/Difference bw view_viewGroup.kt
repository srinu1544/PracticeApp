In Android development, Views and ViewGroups are essential components.
Views are the basic building blocks of the user interface (UI). They are small rectangular boxes
that respond to user inputs. Examples of Views include: EditText, Button, CheckBox.

ViewGroups are invisible containers that hold other Views or ViewGroups. They organize and arrange Views.
ViewGroups use layout managers to determine the positioning and sizing of Views within them.

ViewGroups are a subclass of View. They provide the android layout in which we can order the appearance
and sequence of views.
Examples of ViewGroups include: LinearLayout.
ViewGroups are also known as:
Widgets
Base class for layouts and layouts parameters
