In Jetpack Compose, a state is a value that can change over time and is related to updating the UI.
Jetpack Compose automatically updates the UI whenever a state value changes. The state can be of any
type, such as a Boolean or a String.

State is represented by a mutableStateOf function. This function takes an initial value and returns a
MutableState object. The object contains the current state of the UI element and can be modified and
passed around.

Some techniques for managing state in Jetpack Compose include:

ViewModel: A lifecycle-aware class that can hold the data for the composable function
State hoisting: Exposing both a stateful and a stateless version of the same composable
Jetpack Compose is a toolkit for building native UI on Android. It combines a reactive
programming model with the Kotlin programming language*/
