/*
Android also has Activity flags that can change the default behavior of an Activity that
is associated with Tasks. These flags can be set on an Intent to change its behavior.
For example, flags can control whether an Intent should start a new activity or return results.
Here are some examples of Android flags:

FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK
If a task is already running for the activity being started, a new activity will not be started.
 Instead, the current task will be brought to the front of the screen.*/
