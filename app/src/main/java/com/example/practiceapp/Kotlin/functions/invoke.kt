/*In Kotlin, the invoke function is a special operator function that allows you to treat an object
as if it were a function.
This means you can call an object like a function by using the () Parentheses operator.
This is especially useful when you want to make
an instance of a class callable like a function, providing a more natural and
concise syntax for certain operations.*/

        return x + y
