/*
In Kotlin, the open keyword is used to declare a class, function, or property as open for extension.
When you mark a class, function, or property with the open keyword, it means that other classes can
inherit from that class, override that function, or override that property. This is a fundamental
concept in Kotlin's support for object-oriented programming and inheritance.


by default all the class, functions , variables  in kotlin are final
if you try to inherit a class necessary to put open keyword in front of the class

-> if you want to override function or variable necessary to put open keyword
