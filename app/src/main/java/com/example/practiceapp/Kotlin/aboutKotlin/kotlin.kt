1) what is kotlin
-----------------

Kotlin is a statically typed, general-purpose programming language developed by JetBrains, that has built world-class IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, PhpStorm, Appcode, etc. It was first introduced by JetBrains in 2011 and is a new language for the JVM. Kotlin is an object-oriented language, and a “better language” than Java, but still be fully interoperable with Java code.
Kotlin is sponsored by Google, announced as one of the official languages for Android Development in 2017

2)  Key Features of Kotlin
---------------------------

1. Statically typed – Statically typed is a programming language characteristic that means the type of every
 variable and expression is known at compile time. Although it is statically typed language, it does not
 require you to explicitly specify the type of every variable you declare.

2.Data Classes– In Kotlin, there are Data Classes which lead to auto-generation of boilerplate like equals,
hashCode, toString, getters/setters and much more.
Consider the following example –

3.Concise – It drastically reduces the extra code written in other object-oriented programming languages.

4.Safe – It provides the safety from most annoying and irritating NullPointerExceptions by supporting
nullability as part of its system.
Every variable in Kotlin is non-null by default.

5.Interoperable with Java – Kotlin runs on Java Virtual Machine(JVM) so it is totally interoperable with java.
We can easily access java code from kotlin and kotlin code from java.

6.Functional and Object Oriented Capabilities – Kotlin has a rich set of many useful methods which includes
higher-order functions, lambda expressions, operator overloading, lazy evaluation, operator overloading and much more.
Higher order function is a function which accepts a function as a parameter or returns a function or can do both.

7.Smart Cast – It explicitly typecasts the immutable values and inserts the value in its safe cast automatically.
If we try to access a nullable type of String ( String? = “BYE”) without safe cast it will generate a compile
error.

8.Compilation time – It has higher performance and fast compilation time.

9.Tool- Friendly – It has excellent tooling support. Any of the Java IDEs – IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse and
Android Studio can be used for Kotlin. We can also be run Kotlin program from command line.

3)  Advantages of Kotlin language:
----------------------------------

Easy to learn – Basic is almost similar to java.If anybody worked in java then easily understand in no time.
Kotlin is multi-platform – Kotlin is supported by all IDEs of java so you can write your program and execute them on any machine which supports JVM.
It’s much safer than Java.
It allows using the Java frameworks and libraries in your new Kotlin projects by using advanced frameworks without any need to change the whole project in Java.
Kotlin programming language, including the compiler, libraries and all the tooling is completely free and open source and available on github. Here is the link for Github
