polymorphism :
--------------

mainly overriding , overloading

The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as
the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.

Types of polymorphism
Polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:

Compile-time Polymorphism (overload)
Runtime Polymorphism      (overriding)

overload - same name different  parameter list same class is called overload

override - same name same parameter list in different class called override

Examples
Example 1: Compile-time Polymorphism

Letâ€™s start with compile-time polymorphism. In compile-time polymorphism,
the name functions, that is, the signature remains the same but parameters
 or return type is different. At compile time, the compiler then resolves
 which functions we are trying to call based on the type of parameters and more.
