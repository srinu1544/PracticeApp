/*Kotlin allows you to provide custom implementations for the predefined set of operators on types. These operators have predefined
symbolic representation (like + or *) and precedence. To implement an operator, provide a member function or an extension function
with a specific name for the corresponding type. This type becomes the left-hand side type for binary operations and the argument
type for the unary ones */
