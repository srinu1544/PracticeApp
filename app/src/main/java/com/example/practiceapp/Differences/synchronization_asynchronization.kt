/*
synchronization :
-----------------

-> it allows one thread at onc

Synchronization is a programming technique in which tasks are executed in a specific order.
This means that one task will not start executing until another task has finished executing.
Synchronization is used to ensure that data is accessed and modified in a safe and consistent
manner.


asynchronization :

 ->  it can allows more than one thread at once

Asynchronization is a programming technique in which tasks are executed independently of
each other. This means that one task can start executing before another task has finished
executing. Asynchronization can be used to improve the performance of your application by
allowing multiple tasks to run at the same time.


Kotlin provides a number of features that can be used to implement asynchronization and synchronization. These features include:
Coroutines: Coroutines are a lightweight and efficient way to implement asynchronization in Kotlin.

Threads: Threads can be used to implement both asynchronization and synchronization in Kotlin.

Locks: Locks can be used to synchronize access to shared resources.

Semaphores: Semaphores can be used to control the number of threads that can access a shared
resource.
