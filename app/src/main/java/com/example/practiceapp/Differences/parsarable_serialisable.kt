In the context of Android programming, "parsable" and "serializable" refer to two different ways of
transferring data between components or persisting data. Let's explore the differences between them:

Parcelable:
-----------
Parcelable is an Android-specific interface that allows you to serialize and deserialize objects efficiently,
especially for inter-process communication (IPC) within an Android application.
Parcelable is optimized for performance, making it a better choice when you need to pass objects between
Android components like Activities, Fragments, or Services, or when you want to save and restore the state
of objects quickly.
To make a class Parcelable, you need to implement the Parcelable interface, which requires you to define
how the object's data is written to and read from a Parcel, a specialized Android class for efficient data
serialization.

Serializable:
Serializable is a Java interface that allows you to mark a class as serializable,
which means the object's
state can be converted into a stream of bytes and then reconstructed from that stream.
Serializable is a more general-purpose approach and can be used in non-Android Java applications as well.
While Serializable is easier to implement (just implement the interface), it tends to be less efficient
than Parcelable in Android, particularly when it comes to performance-critical scenarios like passing data
between activities or saving state.

In summary, Parcelable is Android-specific and optimized for efficient data transfer between Android
components, whereas Serializable is a more generic Java mechanism for object serialization that can also
be used in Android but may not perform as well in certain situations. When working with Android components
and needing to transfer complex objects efficiently, Parcelable is generally preferred.
