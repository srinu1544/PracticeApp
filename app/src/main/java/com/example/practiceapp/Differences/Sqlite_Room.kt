sqlite vs room which is faster ? *
-----------------------------------

Room is faster than SQLite for loading large lists on an Android phone. Room is also more powerful
and improves data loading times.
Room is an API that uses different classes to interact with the SQLite database.
Room simplifies database operations by reducing boilerplate code and automatically
handling tasks like query generation and result mapping. It also offers a more intuitive
and developer-friendly API for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Room is still SQLite, but it's enhanced to make it easier for developers to write better
and cleaner code
