/*In Java, annotations are metadata that can be used to provide additional information
about a program. They are prefixed with an at sign (@) and can be applied to classes,
 methods, fields, parameters, and packages.

Annotations can be used for a variety of purposes, including:
Providing information to the compiler, such as the purpose of a method or the type of a
parameter
Suppressing warnings
Generating code at runtime
Controlling the behavior of a program

There are two types of annotations in Java:
predefined annotations and custom annotations.

Predefined annotations are those that are provided by the Java platform.
Examples of predefined annotations include:
@Override: Indicates that a method overrides a method in a superclass
@SuppressWarnings: Suppresses warnings from the compiler
@Documented: Indicates that a method or field is intended to be documented
Custom annotations are those that are defined by the user.
Examples of custom annotations include:
@Author: Indicates the author of a class or method
@Version: Indicates the version of a class or method
@Todo: Indicates a task that needs to be completed

Annotations can be applied using the @ symbol followed by the name of the annotation.
 For example, to annotate a method with the @Override annotation, you would use the
 following syntax:

@Override
public void myMethod() {
  // Method body
}
Use code with caution.

Annotations can be read using the reflection API. The reflection API is a set of classes
that allow you to inspect the metadata of a program at runtime.

Annotations are a powerful feature that can be used to improve the quality and
maintainability of Java programs.*/
