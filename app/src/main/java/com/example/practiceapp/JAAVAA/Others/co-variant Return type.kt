/*Here is an explanation of covariant return types in Java:

In Java, a covariant return type is a return type that can be overridden to a subtype
of the original return type. This means that if a method is overridden in a subclass,
then the return type of the overriding method can be a subtype of the return type of
the overridden method.

For example, let's say we have a Shape class with a method getArea(). The return type of
this method is double. Now, let's say we have a subclass of Shape called Circle.
We can override the getArea() method in Circle to return a double value that is
the area of a circle.

This is an example of a covariant return type. The return type of the overridden
 method (double) is a subtype of the return type of the original method (double).

Covariant return types are useful because they can help to make code more reusable and
maintainable. For example, in the example above, we can use the getArea() method on any
shape object, regardless of whether it is a Shape object or a Circle object. This is
because the return type of the method is covariant, so it can return a double value,
which is the area of any shape object.

Here are some advantages of using covariant return types in Java:
They can help to make code more reusable.
They can help to make code more maintainable.
They can help to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written.
Here are some disadvantages of using covariant return types in Java:
They can make it more difficult to reason about the types of objects.
They can make it more difficult to find errors in code.

Overall, covariant return types can be a useful feature for making code more reusable
and maintainable. However, it is important to be aware of the potential disadvantages
of using covariant return types before using them in your code*/
