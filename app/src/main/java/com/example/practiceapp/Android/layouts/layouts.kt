/*
Android provides several types of layouts that you can use to organize and arrange UI components (views)
within your app's user interface. Each layout type has its own purpose and behavior. Here are some of
the most commonly used Android layout types:

LinearLayout:

This layout arranges child views either horizontally or vertically in a single line. You can specify
the orientation using the android:orientation attribute. It's simple and efficient for creating simple
linear arrangements.

**RelativeLayout:**
Allows you to position child views relative to each other or relative to the parent layout.
You can specify rules like aligning to the top, bottom, left, or right of other views. It's flexible for
creating complex UIs.

**ConstraintLayout:**
Introduced in recent versions of Android, this layout allows you to create complex layouts
with a flat view hierarchy. You can set constraints between views, making it easy to create responsive and
flexible designs.

**FrameLayout:**
This layout is designed to hold a single child view, positioned at the top-left corner. It's often
used for fragments and overlays.

**GridLayout:**
Arranges child views in a grid of rows and columns. You can specify the number of rows and columns
and assign views to specific grid cells.

** TableLayout: **
Organizes child views in rows and columns, similar to an HTML table. It's less flexible than
GridLayout but can be useful for certain types of UIs.

**ScrollView:**
Allows you to create scrollable layouts when the content overflows the screen. You can place
a single child within a ScrollView to make it scrollable.

**ListView**
(deprecated) and RecyclerView: These layouts are used for displaying lists of data. RecyclerView
is the modern replacement for ListView and offers better performance and flexibility.

CardView:
While not a layout in the traditional sense, CardView is often used as a container for grouping
views together, providing a card-like appearance with rounded corners and elevation.

ConstraintSet:
This is not a layout type on its own but is often used in conjunction with ConstraintLayout
to define constraints programmatically in your code.

Custom Layouts:
You can create custom layouts by extending existing layouts or implementing your own layout
logic by extending the ViewGroup class.

Choosing the right layout type depends on your app's specific design requirements. You may also use a
combination of these layouts within your app's hierarchy to achieve the desired UI structure. Additionally,
Android's layout system is continually evolving, so be sure to check the latest documentation and best practices for the most up-to-date information.
