Android 14 features :

More Customization
You have long been able to customize your home screen, but with Android 14,
you get more tools to customize your lock screen. There's a lock screen picker,
lock screen templates, a monochromatic theme, and support for Ultra HDR images.
You can also create parallax effect wallpapers using your own photos, cartoon-style wallpapers
with your favorite emoji, and even generative AI wallpapers based on text prompts.


Improved Battery Life :
There is no headline feature here, but Google has put some serious effort into improving Android’s
efficiency to reduce power drain. Changes to how the operating system handles background tasks, downloads,
and uploads, alongside a few other tweaks, should enable Android owners to squeeze a little more life from
their phone batteries. It also looks as though the option to check “screen time since last full charge” in
the battery settings menu (removed in Android 12) is back.

Larger Fonts and Smarter Scaling :
Switching to a larger font in Android 13 was limited to 130 percent on Google's Pixel phones,
but Android 14 allows you to scale fonts up to 200 percent. To prevent wonky layouts, the system
uses nonlinear scaling, which means any words that are already scaled up (such as headings) won't grow
larger, making the text more readable for folks with vision impairment.


Notification Flashes :
Android 14 enables you to turn on camera flashes and screen flashes for incoming notifications.
This has been available on other Android smartphones (like Samsung devices) and iPhones for years,
but it hasn't been baked into the operating system itself. You can turn on one or the other, or
both, and choose the color your display will flash. Primarily designed to help people with hearing
loss, it can come in handy for anyone who doesn't want their phone to make a noise or buzz with every
incoming notification.


Better Hearing Aid Support :
More good news for folks with hearing loss, as Android 14 will stop lumping hearing aids in with other
Bluetooth devices. There is a new dedicated page for hearing devices, and you can choose which sounds
should go to your hearing aids and what should come through the device's speakers. And to help prevent
hearing damage, Android 14 will warn you when you have been listening to loud music for too long with a
pop-up notification.

Better Support for Large Screens :
The first thing Google announced in the initial developer preview was help for developers trying to build
apps that adapt gracefully to different screen sizes. With more tools and design advice available for
developers, we can expect apps that work well across smartphones, folding phones, and tablets. This
would mirror what Apple has done to make its app ecosystem transition seamlessly from iPhone to iPad
to MacBook.

Restricting Photo and Video Access :

    Allow access to all photos
        select photos
          dont allow


If you are uncomfortable with the all-or-nothing nature of granting an app access to your photos and
videos, you will be pleased to learn that Android 14 adds an option to select the specific photos and
videos it is allowed to access. Apple introduced a similar feature in iOS 14.


Enhanced Security :
Since malware tends to target older versions of Android to avoid security enhancements in newer versions,
Android 14 won't let you install older apps from Android 5.1 and earlier. There are a few other
behind-the-scenes tweaks to improve security, but perhaps most notable is improved support for
authentication with passkeys enabling biometric login instead of using passwords for more apps.


Protected PIN :
There's another security and convenience enhancement in Android 14 for the humble PIN. You can now turn
off the animations that appear when you enter your PIN to make it harder for other folks to spy your digits.
If your PIN is six characters or longer, you can also get rid of the OK button at the end and just have it
unlock when you input the final number.

Data Protection :
Keeping track of what apps and games are doing with your data is much tougher than
it should be. You might grant apps access to some data based on their policy when you install,
but what if they are acquired by another company or change their policy for some other reason
and decide to sell your data to advertisers or other third-parties? Android 14 will send you
a monthly warning when apps have changed their data sharing habits.

Regional Preferences :
Whether you prefer the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit, Monday or Sunday as the start of your week,
or specific calendars or numerals, you can set these system wide in Android 14 and they will persist through
backup and restore. There is also improved support for gendered languages like French, and better language
customization based on region.

Predictive Back Gestures
Google has added a prominent back arrow that matches your wallpaper or theme for clearer gesture navigation.
Coupled with predictive back gestures, which afford you a glimpse of the screen that a swipe-back gesture
will take you to, it should be easier for folks to understand how to navigate and where they will land.
It is not currently obvious where a back swipe will take you in Android; sometimes it is the home screen,
sometimes a previous screen, or an app.

Health Connect :
You might use one app for your smart scales, another for running, and yet another to track your sleep.
Google's Health Connect app offers a way to centralize your health and fitness data and share it across
different apps and services, though it is still in beta. The app comes preinstalled on all Android 14
devices and will update automatically.

Improved Share Options :
The share menu in Android has long been inconsistent across different Android devices and apps.
Google is now allowing apps to add custom actions to system share sheets, and more app data is
being used to determine the ranking of your potential share targets. This should allow for a
more consistent and useful sharing menu that features the apps and contacts you actually want
to share with.
