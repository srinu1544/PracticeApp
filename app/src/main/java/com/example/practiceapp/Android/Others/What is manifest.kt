/*In Android development, the AndroidManifest.xml file is a critical configuration
file that provides essential information about your Android app to the Android operating
system. It's a fundamental part of every Android app and is located in the root directory
of your Android project.

Here are some of the key elements and information that are typically included in the
AndroidManifest.xml file:

Package Name:
The package name uniquely identifies your app on the device. It is specified
in the package attribute of the <manifest> element and is used to distinguish
your app from others.

Application Components:
The manifest file declares various application components, including activities, services,
broadcast receivers, and content providers. Each of these components is specified with
elements like <activity>, <service>, <receiver>, and <provider>. These components define
the entry points and behavior of your app.

Permissions:
The manifest file lists the permissions that your app requires to function properly.
Permissions are declared using the <uses-permission> element. Android users are informed
about the permissions your app requires when they install it, and they can choose to grant
or deny those permissions.

Intent Filters:
Activities and other components often define intent filters to specify which types of
 intents (requests for specific actions) they can respond to. This allows other apps
 and the system to interact with your app through intents.

Launch Activity:
The manifest specifies which activity is the main or launcher activity using
 <intent-filter> element within an <activity> declaration. This activity is the
 entry point of your app when it is launched by the user.

App Icon:
The <application> element can include an <icon> attribute that specifies the app's icon.

Theme:
You can define the theme or style that your app uses by specifying it in the <application>
element using the android:theme attribute.

Supported Screen Sizes and Densities:
 The <supports-screens> element allows you to specify which screen sizes and densities
 your app supports.

Minimum and Target SDK Versions:
You can set the minimum and target Android SDK versions that your app is compatible with
using the <uses-sdk> element.

Configuration Changes Handling:
You can specify how your app handles configuration changes (e.g., screen orientation changes)
using the android:configChanges attribute within the <activity> element.

Debugging and Testing Information:
The manifest can contain information for debugging and testing purposes, such as the
<application> element's android:debuggable attribute.

Metadata and Custom Information: You can include custom metadata and additional
information in the manifest as needed for your app's functionality.

The AndroidManifest.xml file is a crucial component of Android app development,
as it defines how the Android system interacts with your app and how other apps
can interact with it. It plays a vital role in the app's installation, permissions,
and behavior.
