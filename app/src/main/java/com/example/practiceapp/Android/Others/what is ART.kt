Android ART (Android Runtime) is the runtime environment used by the Android operating
system to execute applications written in the Java programming language and some other
languages. ART replaced the older Dalvik runtime in Android 5.0 (Lollipop) as the default
runtime for Android applications.

Here are some key points about Android ART:

Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation:
One of the significant differences between ART and Dalvik
is that ART uses an Ahead-of-Time compilation approach. In Dalvik, applications were
compiled into bytecode, and the bytecode was interpreted at runtime. In contrast, ART
compiles the bytecode into native machine code during the installation of an app. This
results in improved app performance because the code is already compiled when it is
executed, reducing the overhead of on-the-fly bytecode interpretation.

Improved Performance:
ART's AOT compilation generally leads to faster app startup times and smoother performance
compared to the older Dalvik runtime. Apps compiled with ART tend to run more efficiently
because they don't need to be JIT (Just-In-Time) compiled each time they are launched.

Improved Garbage Collection:
ART introduces a more efficient garbage collection mechanism compared to Dalvik, which
helps manage memory more effectively, reducing the chances of application crashes due
to memory issues.

64-bit Support:
ART supports 64-bit architectures, which is important for modern smartphones that use
64-bit processors. This allows for better utilization of system resources and improved
performance for apps that are optimized for 64-bit execution.

Compatibility:
While ART is designed to improve performance, it is also backward-compatible with apps
written for Dalvik. Android automatically converts Dalvik bytecode to ART bytecode during
installation, so older apps can still run on devices with ART.

Developer Tools:
Android provides developer tools and options for analyzing and optimizing apps running on
the ART runtime. Developers can use these tools to profile their apps and identify
performance bottlenecks.

Overall, Android ART plays a crucial role in enhancing the performance and efficiency of
Android applications, contributing to a smoother user experience on Android devices.*/
