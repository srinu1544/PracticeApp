/*In Android development, a "View" is a fundamental building block of the user interface (UI).
Views are used to create the visual elements of an app, such as buttons, text fields, images,
and more. Each View represents a rectangular area on the screen and can be used to interact
with the user or display information.

The Android View Lifecycle refers to the series of events and states that a View can go
through during its existence within an Android app. Understanding the View Lifecycle is
crucial for managing the appearance, behavior, and state of Views in response to various
 events.
