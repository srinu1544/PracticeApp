/*The android:exported attribute in Android defines whether a component of
an app can be launched by other applications. The attribute can be used for
activities, services, and receivers.

If the attribute is set to true, any app can access the activity and launch it by
its exact class name. If the attribute is set to false, other apps have no ability
to access the provider's content.*/
