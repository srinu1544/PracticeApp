/*A repository in Android is a class that provides a clean API for accessing data.
It isolates data sources, such as a Room database and web services, from the rest of the app.

A repository can:
Expose data: Expose data to the rest of the app
Centralize changes: Centralize changes to data
Resolve conflicts: Resolve conflicts between multiple data sources
Abstract data sources: Abstract sources of data from the rest of the app
Contain business logic: Contain business logic
Hide data storage details: Hide the details of how data is stored or retrieved to and from the
data store A repository is considered the single source of truth in an Android application.
It acts as an abstraction over a particular data source. This enables an application to consume
data without worrying about its origin.

Using repositories is a recommended best practice for code separation and architecture. */
